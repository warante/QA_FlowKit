# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - MVP starter

Initial open-source starter package.

Included:

- Portable `.qa-ai/` folder.
- Preset-aware init, doctor, feature validation and adapter sync scripts.
- Manifest-based clean script with dry-run default and hash protection.
- Agent-first `/qa-init` bootstrap script and commands for Claude Code and OpenCode.
- Rules, agents, workflows and templates.
- Multi-agent documentation and adapters.
- Roadmap and backlog for implementation with Codex Desktop.

Refined:

- Safe no-overwrite behavior unless `--force` is passed.
- Config-aware doctor and feature validation.
- Adapter selection with default all-adapter generation.
- Init manifest tracking for generated files and adapter copies.
- Claude and OpenCode slash commands for init, full flow, doctor, clean and feature validation.
- Guided slash-command UX when commands are called without arguments.
- Copy-only bootstrap flow: copy `.qa-ai/`, run `bootstrap-agent-adapters.mjs`, then open the agent.
- End-to-end workflow documentation for folder-copy usage.
